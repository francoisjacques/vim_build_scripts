# About

Building vim is not hard, but the setup of configuration files is a bit tedious.

These files intend to make it easier. 

# Instructions

## Windows

* Grab a snapshot of vim at ..\vim
* Invoke build_vim_win32.bat

## Unix

* Grab a snapshot of vim at ../vim
* Invoke configure_vim.sh

# Disclaimer

It works on my machine :-)
